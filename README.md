# Overview

A clone of the game Flappy Bird, Flappy Dragon accepts touch input from the user to navigate a dragon through pipes. Hit the play button and enjoy the game!

I have wanted to not only practice my Java, but also develop an app. This was a great intoduction for me to learn how to draw to the screen using Bitmap, 
as well as how to use Events to accept touch input.

# Development Environment

* Android Studio
* Google Pixel Emulator (availablie in Android Studio)

I wrote this program using Java. Some of the Libraries I used were: Bitmap, Canvas, MotionEvent, and Handler.

# Future Work

* A score counter and tracker so that the game remembers your high score
* Collisions so the game ends when the ground or a pipe is hit
* The ability to change characters ie be able to have player sprite be a bird or a dog in a plane
